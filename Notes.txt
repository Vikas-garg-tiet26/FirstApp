// VAriables in Flutter:-

    int days = 30;
    String name = "Acm Project Collab App";
    bool isMAle = true;
    double pi = 3.14;
    num temperature = 3.05;    // num can take both int and float

// declaring a common variable:=

    var day = 5;            // var is used to declare any data type
    const lobby = 2;       //const is applied so that its value doesn't change.
    final lobby1 = 56;    //final and const are just same , the only diff is that final can be modified
  

// Scaffold is used instead of Material because it contains :-
  1.appbar(head)
  2.body
  3.Drawer(footer);
